## About the Project

The Movie App displays a list of movies obtained from an external API. The data, such as movie titles, release dates, and overviews, is fetched dynamically from the API.

### Main Poster for Scream

The main poster for the movie "Scream" is static and different from the rest of the posters. I chose this design because I felt the background color suited it well, and since there was no specific requirement for what the main poster should be, I decided to leave it as part of the overall design.

## Installation and Usage

To run the Movie App locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Credits

The Movie App project is based on the Next.js framework and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. It also makes use of the API provided by [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie data.
